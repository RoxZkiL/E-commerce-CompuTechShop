This e-commerce is a project developed by me and 5 more colleagues from the soy Henry bootcamp.
    
 <br>   

PostgreSQL was used for the database.

In the back-end it was made with NodeJS and Express.

For the front-end React and Redux were used in the styles were used CSS in its pure state, Material-UI, React-Boostrap and React-Styled-Components
in addition to a library for forms (Formik).

MercadoPago was used as a payment platform and Auth0 was used for user login.

The functionalities of this project are those of a traditional E-Commerce. It has its own user registration system or with google. You can choose from the product lists the one you like, add it to the cart or favorites and buy it.

You have the possibility (in administrator mode) to add products, edit and delete them, you can also ban users)

The user registration system is made to prevent purchases from users not logged in (registered). You will be able to see your shopping cart (the items inside it) even if you are logged out.

When you make a purchase you will receive an email saying that your purchase is on its way and in the same way when you register on the page telling you that your registration has been successful.

You can edit your user information after registration as well as change your profile picture and at the time of purchase you can change the shipping address if you wish.

These, among many others, are some of the features of the project.
